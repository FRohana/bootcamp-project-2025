        <h2>Why I Got Into Computer Engineering</h2>

          My journey into computer engineering started in seventh grade when I
          built my first custom PC. After that build, my passion grew through
          coding projects in Python and Java, where I developed applications
          like a painting program and discovered how I loved creating things
          with code. Then, working in my school's Maker Lab, I fell in love not
          only with code but with hardware too. I learned to design circuits,
          etch circuit boards, and understand how physical components power the
          systems I was programming. Eventually, I built a whack-a-mole arcade
          game where I designed the circuit board, programmed the logic, and 3D
          modeled the cabinet, combining both passions. That's why I love
          computer engineering. It's perfect for me because it bridges software
          and hardware, letting me work in two disciplines I'm passionate about.
